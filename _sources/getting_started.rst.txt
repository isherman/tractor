Getting Started
===============

This guide describes how to install and extend farm-ng software.

If you're already familiar with the farm-ng codebase, and looking for packaged binaries, please see
:ref:`Docker Releases<getting_started-docker-releases>`.

.. _section-development_environment:

Setting up your Development Environment
=======================================
We have chosen to encapsulate the development environment in a Docker container, to simplify reproducibility.
It's also possible to build on bare metal, and the Dockerfiles serve as documentation for our system dependencies.

We fully support Visual Studio Code, and describe a recommended configuration below.

This workflow has been tested on development machines running Ubuntu (18.04, 20.04) Desktop, NVidia's Jetson Nano and Xavier platforms, and Mac OS.
Windows support should also be possible, but hasn't been tested.

To get started, you'll need a few system tools installed:

- ``git``
- ``docker``
- ``docker-compose``
- ``vscode``

Install ``git``:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

      .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install git


   .. group-tab:: Mac OSX

      .. code-block:: bash

         brew install git

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      TODO

Install ``docker``:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

      Please follow the `official Docker installation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_ instructions.

      Ensure that you have added your user to the ``docker`` group, and logged out and back in:

      .. code-block:: bash

        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


   .. group-tab:: Mac OSX

      Please follow the `official Docker installation <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>`_ instructions.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      TODO


Install ``docker-compose``:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

      Using pip:

      .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install pip3
        sudo pip3 install docker-compose


   .. group-tab:: Mac OSX

      ``docker-compose`` is included in the `Docker Desktop for Mac` installer used to install ``docker``.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

      TODO

Install ``vscode``:

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Ubuntu

      Please follow the `official Visual Studio Code installation <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download/>`_ instructions.

   .. group-tab:: Mac OSX

      Please follow the `official Visual Studio Code installation <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download/>`_ instructions.

   .. group-tab:: Windows

Get the code
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/farm-ng/tractor.git

Start the development container
-------------------------------

``docker-compose`` can be used to start the development Docker
container.  It mounts the repository from your host as a volume.For
convenience, we've wrapped the docker-compose commands in Makefile
located under ``$FARM_NG_ROOT/docker/devel``.

The following command starts the development docker environment in the background.

.. code-block:: bash

  make -C docker/devel upd

On the first run, the development environment docker image is built, inheriting the user name, UID and GID of the parent shell.
You should see something similar to:

.. code-block::

   ~/code/tractor$ make -C docker/devel upd
   Building workspace
   Successfully built c0861fd269b0
   Successfully tagged devel_workspace:latest
   Creating devel_workspace_1 ... done
   farm-ng's devel container is running.  Run make down to stop it.
   You can open up a shell inside the container:
      docker exec -it devel_workspace_1 bash


To stop the container, run ``make -C docker/devel down``


Now the Docker container is up and running.  You can ``exec`` into it, interactively, and open as many shells as you like with the following command:

.. code-block::

   docker exec -it devel_workspace_1 bash


Try the following, on your host machine, to configure the ``cmake`` build inside the container:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker exec devel_workspace_1 make cmake


You should see something similar to::

   -- The C compiler identification is GNU 7.5.0
   ...
   -- Configuring done
   -- Generating done
   -- Build files have been written to: /workspace/tractor/build


Now that the code is configured, you should see a ``build/`` directory on the host machine with a ``Makefile`` and ``CMakeCache.txt``

Let's try building these docs::

   docker exec devel_workspace_1 make -C build docs


And run a server to host them::

   docker exec devel_workspace_1 bash -c "cd build/doc/sphinx && python3 -m http.server 8000"

Try browsing to http://localhost:8000/getting_started.html#start-the-development-container

Now take a moment to study the contents of ``docker/devel/docker-compose.yaml``:

.. literalinclude:: ../docker/devel/docker-compose.yml
   :language: yaml

- The source directory is mounted at ``/workspace/tractor``.
- A named volume is mounted at ``/home/$USERNAME`` -- this allows the container to persist bash history and other cached variables.
- A host directory is mounted as the ``BLOBSTORE_ROOT`` for :ref:`persistent storage of application data<section-core_blobstore>`.


To start the development environment with a custom BLOBSTORE_ROOT::

   make BLOBSTORE_ROOT=/some/other/blobstore/root -C docker/devel upd

To start the development environment with a custom devel docker image::

   make FARM_NG_DEVEL_IMAGE=farmng/devel:latest -C docker/devel upd

To build a the devel image locally:

   cd docker/devel
   ./build_devel.sh # this will result in farmng/devel:latest
   make FARM_NG_DEVEL_IMAGE=farmng/devel:latest down
   make FARM_NG_DEVEL_IMAGE=farmng/devel:latest upd


Visual Studio Code setup
------------------------

Now that you're comfortable execing into the development container let's boot up ``vscode``.

Start ``vscode`` in the normal way and install the extension ``ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers``.

Attach to the container ``devel_workspace_1`` using **Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container**.

.. note::

   For additional background, see vscode documentation on `container-based workflows <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/attach-container>`_.

Once you're attached, open the workspace file ``/workspace/tractor/workspace.code-workspace`` and install the suggested plugins.

Wait while ``vscode`` installs the extensions.

Try building with ``cmake`` in ``vscode`` by pressing ``F7``.

- Click `Unspecified` when prompted to `Select a Kit`.
- You can see the build output in the `CMake/Build` output window.

Developing on a Remote Host
------------------------------

This workflow above should also work if you're connected to a remote host.
This is how we develop on remote machines such as robots.

To attach to a remote container over SSH just add the following to your `User Settings <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations>`_:

.. code-block::

   "docker.host":"ssh://your-remote-user@your-remote-machine-fqdn-or-ip-here"

Restart ``vscode``, and the workflow above should connect you to the Docker container on your remote host.

.. note::

   For additional background, see vscode documentation on `remote container workflows <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-advanced#_a-basic-remote-example>`_.


Building the code
-----------------

To build our C++ and protobuf generated code, we use ``cmake``.  From inside the Docker container (either in the ``exec`` shell, or a terminal in VS code) you can run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /workspace/tractor
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/farm_ng/env ..
   make -j$(nproc --ignore=1)

   # Run the ipc_logger
   cd /workspace/tractor
   ./build/modules/core/cpp/farm_ng/ipc_logger

To build our webservices (Typescript and Go) run:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /workspace/tractor
   make webservices

   # Run the webservices
   PORT=9999 build/go/farm_ng_webservices

Try browsing to `<http://localhost:9999/>`_.


.. note::

   We'll transition all the build steps to ``cmake`` eventually...


Git workflow
============

pre-commit
++++++++++

Please install pre-commit for static linting on your host machine.  We don't yet support git commiting from the development environment.

Install the following:
 * pre-commit -  https://pre-commit.com/#install
 * buf for protobuf linting - https://docs.buf.build/installation/

To have pre-commit run on every commit, run the following at the root of the repository::

  pre-commit install

If you don't want it part of your git pre-commit check, you can run this via the devel image via::

  ./devel.sh pre-commit run --all-files
